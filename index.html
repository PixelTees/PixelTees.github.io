  <p>The web is today’s Main Street because it gives businesses global visibility through DNS and browsers—“the Internet is, fundamentally, a global logistics network.” A simple domain name becomes a digital storefront that anyone can access 24/7, turning casual visitors into customers regardless of location. Instead of relying on local foot traffic, businesses now depend on search engines and shared links, reaching people instantly across the globe. This transformation means even the smallest ventures can thrive online, just as they once did on a bustling street corner.</p>

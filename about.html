    <h1>About Our Company</h1>
    <p> I started PixelTees by Powell because I’ve always believed that clothing should tell a story—our story. Growing up surrounded by creativity, I found joy in blending art, identity, and self-expression through design. *Pixel Tees* was born from a desire to give people something more than just a t-shirt; I wanted to create wearable canvases that celebrate individuality, culture, and the power of community. Every design is personal—crafted with love, passion, and a bit of nostalgia—because this brand is not just a business, it’s a piece of who I am.</p>
